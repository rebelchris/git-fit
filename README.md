# 🏋️‍♂️ Git-Fit

The only workout tracker that scales with your AI generation latency.

"You’ve sent the prompt. The AI is 'thinking.' Your Mac's fans are spinning. You have 45 seconds of dead time. What are you doing with your life?"

Git-Fit monitors your developer workflow and turns the "Progress Bar Boredom" into a high-intensity micro-workout.

## How it works

- Detection: Git-Fit observes when high-CPU processes (like xcodebuild, cursor, or docker) are active.
- The Interrupt: When you switch away from your IDE while an agent is working, Git-Fit triggers a "Commit to Gains" session.
- The Workout: 20-60-second exercises designed for people in hoodies.

## Why is there no code here?

Note: This repository currently serves as the distribution hub for the Git-Fit macOS binary.

## Privacy & Security:

- Local-First: We don't have a backend. Your PRs (Personal Records) stay on your machine.
- Zero Tracking: No analytics. No telemetry. Just you and the iron.
- Process Monitoring: We use local system APIs to detect active dev tools. We never read your code or keystrokes.

## Installation

- Go to the Releases page.
- Download Git-Fit-v1.0.0.dmg.
- Drag to Applications.
- Grant Accessibility Permissions: (Required to detect when your IDE is the active window).
